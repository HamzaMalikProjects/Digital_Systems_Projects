# Digital Systems

This repository contains course materials for the Digital Logic Circuits course. The course is designed to provide a solid understanding of the basic concepts in modern digital system design, with a focus on digital logic circuits.

Course Overview:
- Basic logic circuits and Boolean algebra
- Implementation technologies, from transistors to CPLDs and FPGAs
- Logic functions optimization and implementation
- Number representation and arithmetic circuits
- Combinational circuits
- Synchronous and asynchronous sequential circuits
- Introduction to control unit data path and CPU operations
- CAD Tools and Hands-on Experience
- The course computer-aided design (CAD) tools, including the use of hardware description language (HDL) for design entry. Practical experience in using these tools to design and simulate basic digital circuits. The implementation and testing of simple digital systems using LSI and CPLD technologies is also explored.
